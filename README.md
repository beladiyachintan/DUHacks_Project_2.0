``TITLE``

Controlled Lift Using PLC and SCADA

``DESCRIPTION``

Day to day life we see normal lift in out flats. but there we no need to visualize menas no need SCADA screen, If we go industry level then we want to record the data and also need to visualize because any time where our lift are stand so SCADA screen is necesarry. Here we use SCADA so we are recording data as well so end of day or end of this week how much weight of luggage are transferred in this perticular floor that kind of all data we get that is main application as well of this project.

If we go 20 years back then where no lifts are used because at that time normal houses are maximum 3 floors but that time many adult face difficulty to go 3rd floor or ground floor but that time some where we was see the lift but current scenario is some how diffrante to past here every where we see10 to 12 floor building so every people need lift not for only adult people.
Many time we see the accident moment in lift door not closed properly and children are trap in lift but here door also close automatically every work based on sensor. 


``TECHNOLOGY USED``

PLC and SCADA

``PROBLEMS FACED``

when we was making of ladder logic for lift we donâ€™t know  how to make logic but we know only working of lift  then we made input and output  list in my notbook.so it was really helpful in making ladder logic. when we was making input ladder  or output ladder initially use binary bit so we can use multiple time in program.

``INSPIRATION``
 
Always wanted to do something innovative which helps in reducing human effort.

``ADVANTAGES``

 1) Anaylisis of data like weight
 2) Using SCADA screen we can give the command to leap as well

``DISADVANTAGE``

 1) Need electricity always
 2) Full heavy load then it can not work properley.
