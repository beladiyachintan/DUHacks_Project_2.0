``TITLE``

Controlled Lift Using PLC and SCADA

``DESCRIPTION``

Day to day life we see normal lift in out flats. but there we no need to visualize menas no need SCADA screen, If we go industry level then we want to record the data and also need to visualize because any time where our lift are stand so SCADA screen is necesarry. Here we use SCADA so we are recording data as well so end of day or end of this week how much weight of luggage are transferred in this perticular floor that kind of all data we get that is main application as well of this project.

``TECHNOLOGY USED``

PLC
SCADA

``PROBLEMS FACED``

when we was making of ladder logic for lift we donâ€™t know  how to make logic but we know only working of lift  then we made input and output  list in my notbook.so it was really helpful in making ladder logic. when we was making input ladder  or output ladder initially use binary bit so we can use multiple time in program.

``INSPIRATION``
 
Always wanted to do something innovative which helps in reducing human effort.

``ADVANTAGES``

Anaylisis of data
Using SCADA screen we can give the command to leap as well.

``DISADVANTAGE``

Need electricity always
Full heavy load then it can not work properley
